Deschutes County Government
Deschutes County Human Resources Department, in partnership with Deschutes County Leadership, solicits
proposals from qualified parties who wish to be evaluated and considered to provide on-site clinic and/or pharmacy
management and services for Deschutes County Health Plan members and dependents.
Deschutes County encompasses 3,055 square miles located in the central portion of Oregon. In the last several
years, Deschutes County has been the fastest growing county in the state. As the population in the County has grown, the
Deschutes County government has grown as well. Currently, the County has more than 1,060 FTE positions working in
facilities throughout the county.
Deschutes County is governed by the Board of County Commissioners (BOCC). The BOCC consists of three
commissioners, elected at-large, responsible for establishing policies and setting priorities for the County. The other
elected officials for the County include the District Attorney, County Assessor, County Clerk, County Treasurer, Justice of
the Peace, and County Sheriff. Excepting for County Legal and departments overseen by elected officials, the County
Administrator oversees the daily functions and activities of the various County departments.
Deschutes County consists of a variety of departments providing public services that include Public Health and
Behavioral Health services, public safety and emergency services, planning and zoning, community justice, public works
and solid waste. Indirect services that support county operations include finance, human resources, property and facilities
management, internal auditing, information technology, legal counsel, and public information. Deschutes County, through
its Health Benefits Fund, provides health coverage for County employees, their eligible dependents and retired
employees. On February 7, 2011, Deschutes County opened the Deschutes Onsite Clinic (DOC) that provides primary
and episodic care to all covered persons on the health benefits plan. On May 30, 2012, Deschutes County open the DOC
Pharmacy that provides pharmacy services to all covered persons on the health benefits plan.
In addition, Central Oregon Intergovernmental Council (COIC) employees also participate in the Deschutes County
health benefits program and are afforded access to the clinic and pharmacy services. Established in 1972, COIC is a
Council of Governments (COG) serving Deschutes County, as well as Crook, and Jefferson Counties and the
Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. COIC currently has more than 100 employees and is governed by a 17-member
board with representatives from local jurisdictions and economic interests in the region. This organization provides a
means for local government and private industry to work together to address community, transportation, economic and
workforce development issues.
There are approximately 1,150 total employees in the Deschutes County health benefits program and approximately
3,200 total individuals/participants covered under the plan. The budget for the Health Benefits Fund is approximately $16
million per year and is self-funded by Deschutes County and COIC. The DOC Clinic budget accounts for approximately
$1.1 million dollars of that and the DOC Pharmacy accounts for $2.5 million including prescriptions.

Deschutes County Human Resources Department, in partnership with Deschutes County Leadership, solicits
proposals from qualified parties who wish to be evaluated and considered to provide on-site clinic and/or pharmacy
management and services for Deschutes County Health Plan members and dependents.
Deschutes County encompasses 3,055 square miles located in the central portion of Oregon. In the last several
years, Deschutes County has been the fastest growing county in the state. As the population in the County has grown, the
Deschutes County government has grown as well. Currently, the County has more than 1,060 FTE positions working in
facilities throughout the county.
Deschutes County is governed by the Board of County Commissioners (BOCC). The BOCC consists of three
commissioners, elected at-large, responsible for establishing policies and setting priorities for the County. The other
elected officials for the County include the District Attorney, County Assessor, County Clerk, County Treasurer, Justice of
the Peace, and County Sheriff. Excepting for County Legal and departments overseen by elected officials, the County
Administrator oversees the daily functions and activities of the various County departments.
Deschutes County consists of a variety of departments providing public services that include Public Health and
Behavioral Health services, public safety and emergency services, planning and zoning, community justice, public works
and solid waste. Indirect services that support county operations include finance, human resources, property and facilities
management, internal auditing, information technology, legal counsel, and public information. Deschutes County, through
its Health Benefits Fund, provides health coverage for County employees, their eligible dependents and retired
employees. On February 7, 2011, Deschutes County opened the Deschutes Onsite Clinic (DOC) that provides primary
and episodic care to all covered persons on the health benefits plan. On May 30, 2012, Deschutes County open the DOC
Pharmacy that provides pharmacy services to all covered persons on the health benefits plan.
In addition, Central Oregon Intergovernmental Council (COIC) employees also participate in the Deschutes County
health benefits program and are afforded access to the clinic and pharmacy services. Established in 1972, COIC is a
Council of Governments (COG) serving Deschutes County, as well as Crook, and Jefferson Counties and the
Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. COIC currently has more than 100 employees and is governed by a 17-member
board with representatives from local jurisdictions and economic interests in the region. This organization provides a
means for local government and private industry to work together to address community, transportation, economic and
workforce development issues.
There are approximately 1,150 total employees in the Deschutes County health benefits program and approximately
3,200 total individuals/participants covered under the plan. The budget for the Health Benefits Fund is approximately $16
million per year and is self-funded by Deschutes County and COIC. The DOC Clinic budget accounts for approximately
$1.1 million dollars of that and the DOC Pharmacy accounts for $2.5 million including prescriptions.

elected officials for the County include the District Attorney, County Assessor, County Clerk, County Treasurer, Justice of
the Peace, and County Sheriff. Excepting for County Legal and departments overseen by elected officials, the County

Deschutes County consists of a variety of departments providing public services that include Public Health and
Behavioral Health services, public safety and emergency services, planning and zoning, community justice, public works
and solid waste. Indirect services that support county operations include finance, human resources, property and facilities

Deschutes County, a political subdivision of the State of Oregon, is soliciting proposals to provide cost-effective and
quality health care and/or pharmaceutical services for employees, dependents and retirees of Deschutes County and
COIC employees, dependents, and retirees.
In an effort to provide quality care to participants in the County health benefits program, while maintaining control of
health care expenses, Deschutes County established the DOC on-site health clinic for employees, dependents and
retirees in February 2011. Soon after the clinic was established, Deschutes County opened an on-site pharmacy next
to the clinic. Deschutes County provides general health and wellness services and full pharmaceutical services through
the Deschutes Onsite Clinic. The County partners with a Third Party Administrator (TPA) for health plan and claims
administration as well as a Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM), these administrators work closely with the DOC Clinic
and Pharmacy for the benefit of the County and the health plan participants. These services would not be made
available to the general population.
Deschutes County promotes the following objectives of “The Triple Aim,” as developed by the Institute for Healthcare
Improvement.
1. Improve the overall health of employees, dependents and retirees
2. Reduce the per-capita cost for healthcare
3. Improve the individual patient experience in terms of clinical outcome, patient safety and patient satisfaction

Deschutes County Human Resources Department, in partnership with Deschutes County Leadership, solicits
proposals from qualified parties who wish to be evaluated and considered to provide on-site clinic and/or pharmacy
management and services for Deschutes County Health Plan members and dependents.
Deschutes County encompasses 3,055 square miles located in the central portion of Oregon. In the last several
years, Deschutes County has been the fastest growing county in the state. As the population in the County has grown, the
Deschutes County government has grown as well. Currently, the County has more than 1,060 FTE positions working in
facilities throughout the county.
Deschutes County is governed by the Board of County Commissioners (BOCC). The BOCC consists of three
commissioners, elected at-large, responsible for establishing policies and setting priorities for the County. The other
elected officials for the County include the District Attorney, County Assessor, County Clerk, County Treasurer, Justice of
the Peace, and County Sheriff. Excepting for County Legal and departments overseen by elected officials, the County
Administrator oversees the daily functions and activities of the various County departments.
Deschutes County consists of a variety of departments providing public services that include Public Health and
Behavioral Health services, public safety and emergency services, planning and zoning, community justice, public works
and solid waste. Indirect services that support county operations include finance, human resources, property and facilities
management, internal auditing, information technology, legal counsel, and public information. Deschutes County, through
its Health Benefits Fund, provides health coverage for County employees, their eligible dependents and retired
employees. On February 7, 2011, Deschutes County opened the Deschutes Onsite Clinic (DOC) that provides primary
and episodic care to all covered persons on the health benefits plan. On May 30, 2012, Deschutes County open the DOC
Pharmacy that provides pharmacy services to all covered persons on the health benefits plan.

health benefits program and are afforded access to the clinic and pharmacy services. Established in 1972, COIC is a
Council of Governments (COG) serving Deschutes County, as well as Crook, and Jefferson Counties and the
Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. COIC currently has more than 100 employees and is governed by a 17-member
board with representatives from local jurisdictions and economic interests in the region. This organization provides a
means for local government and private industry to work together to address community, transportation, economic and
workforce development issues.
There are approximately 1,150 total employees in the Deschutes County health benefits program and approximately
3,200 total individuals/participants covered under the plan. The budget for the Health Benefits Fund is approximately $16
million per year and is self-funded by Deschutes County and COIC. The DOC Clinic budget accounts for approximately
$1.1 million dollars of that and the DOC Pharmacy accounts for $2.5 million including prescriptions.

improve evaluation score for one or more of the six criteria. Additionally, Deschutes County may opt to
incorporate part or all of these services into the contract with the selected proposer.
Each evaluation committee member (evaluator) will assign a proposal score for each criterion. The combined
scores for the above criteria will constitute the total evaluator score for each proposal. Based on the total
evaluator score, each evaluator will rank proposals. No two proposals may receive the same rank. Both
ratings and rankings will be used to identify up to five proposals for final consideration.
The second stage of evaluation is the final consideration. Final consideration may require proposers to
respond to additional questions, clarify or elaborate on certain aspects of their proposal, operational clinic or
pharmacy site visits, and deliver oral presentations to the evaluation committee. All proposers submitting
proposals will be notified as to whether they will participate in final consideration. Detailed explanations of the
final consideration process will be provided to those vendors invited to participate.
6.3 Cancellation, Delay or Suspension; Rejection of Proposals
The County may cancel, delay, or suspend this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the County as
determined by the County. The County may reject any or all proposals, in whole or in part, if in the best
interest of the County as determined by the County.
6.4 Irregularities
The County reserves the right to waive any non-material irregularities or information in the RFP or in any
proposal.
6.5 Incurred costs
The County is not liable for any costs incurred by a proposer in the preparation and/or presentation of a
proposal.
6.6 Ownership of Documents
Any material submitted by the proposer shall become the property of the County. Materials submitted after a
contract is signed will be subject to the ownership provision of the executed contract. The County reserves
the right to retain all proposals submitted and use any idea in a proposal regardless of whether the proposal is
selected. Deschutes County reserves the right to implement any idea included in any submitted proposal.
6.7 Confidentiality of Information
6.7.1 The County is subject to the Oregon Public Records Law (ORS Chapter 192), which requires
the County to disclose all records generated or received in the transaction of County
business, except as expressly exempted in ORS 192.345, 192.355, or other applicable law.
Examples of exemptions that could be relevant include trade secrets (ORS 192.345 (2)) and
computer programs (ORS 192.345(15)). The County will endeavor not to disclose records
submitted by a Proposer that are exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Law,
subject to the following procedures and limitations.
6.7.2 The entire RFP cannot be marked confidential, nor, shall any pricing be marked confidential.
Page 25 of 63 - Deschutes Onsite Clinic and/or Pharmacy Services - Request for Proposal

--- Page 26 ---

6.7.3 All pages containing the records exempt from disclosure shall be marked “confidential” and
segregated in the following manner:
6.7.3.1 The cover page of the confidential documents must be red, and the header or
footer for each page must provide as follows: “Not Subject to Public Disclosure.”
6.7.3.2 It shall be clearly marked in bulk and on each page of the confidential document.

following: “Refer to confidential information enclosed.”
6.7.3.6 This statement shall be inserted in the place where the requested information
was to have been placed.
6.7.4 Proposers who desire that information be treated as confidential must mark those pages as
“confidential,” cite a specific statutory basis for the exemption, and the reasons why the public
interest would be served by the confidentiality. Should a proposal be submitted as described
in this section no portion of it can be held as confidential unless that portion is segregated as
described in the criteria in subsection c above.
Notwithstanding the above procedures, the County reserves the right to disclose information
that the County determines, in its sole discretion, is not exempt from disclosure or that the
County is directed to disclose by the County’s Attorney, the District Attorney or a court of
competent jurisdiction. Prior to disclosing such information, the County will notify the
Proposer. If the Proposer disagrees with the County’s decision, the County may, but is not
required to enter into an agreement not to disclose the information so long as the Proposer
bears the entire cost, including reasonable attorney’s fees, of any legal action, including any
appeals, necessary to defend or support a no-disclosure decision. Where authorized by law,
and at its sole discretion.
6.8 Selection
A selected proposer will be the one best able to meet the needs of Deschutes County and COIC, based on
the information outlined in this RFP. The determination of the selected proposer will be based on the
information supplied by the proposer in response to the RFP, as well as any additional information requested
or obtained as part of the final consideration process.
Cost will not be the primary factor in the selection of a vendor. Proposed costs shall be all inclusive of the
requested scope, including necessary travel expenses. The County reserves the right to contact vendors on
price and scope clarification at any time throughout the selection and negotiation process.

the proposers’ participation in this process.

Deschutes County consists of a variety of departments providing public services that include Public Health and
